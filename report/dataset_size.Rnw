\caption{Comparison of dataset size between SPEED, Gatza (2009), and PROGENy.
    Gatza et al. derived 18 pathway signatures using only the MCF-10A cell line
        (thus also 18 experiments), and a total of 287 arrays. In 2014, they
        included additional signatures from other sources to a total of 53, but
        some are redundant, others not pathways, and all still limited to
        breast cancer. SPEED (Parikh et al. 2009) assembled consensus
        signatures for for 11 pathways using 69 GEO submissions, 215 different
        conditions and 572 arrays. Our data set consists of 11 pathways, 217
        GEO submissions, 568 different experiments and a total of 2687 arrays.
        This means we use more evidence per pathway and cover a broader set of
        experimental conditions, but also reflects the imposed limitation of
        only considering experiments if there are at least two unperturbed
        arrays available in order to estimate the basal variability. In
        addition, all our expression values are derived from raw data and not
        preprocessed data that we can not reproduce.}
