\subfloat[Overlap of signature genes for different pathways. For the 100 genes
    we selected for each individual pathway, this shows how many of those
    signature genes are present in another pathway as well. The overlap is
    generally low, with the highest numbers between TNFa and NFkB (62)
    and EGFR and MAPK (18). As both of these pathway pairs have one
    component that is directly upstream of the other, this is to be
    exptected. This also shows that the response genes are specific to
    their perturbation and not a common phenotype like stress response
    because of any perturbation.]{

Reactome (incl. Pathifier), SPEED-derived Iorio (2016) and Gatza (2009). PROGENy genes are
different to pathway members and gene annotations, with between 0 and 7 genes
in common. Overlap with other signatures is higher, but still a minor fraction
of the total number of signature genes.]{
