\caption{Overlap of signature genes for different pathways. For the 100 genes
    we selected for each individual pathway, this shows how many of those
        signature genes are present in another pathway as well. The overlap is
        generally minimal, with the highest numbers between TNFa and NFkB (18)
        and EGFR and MAPK (9). As both of these pathway pairs have one
        component that is directly upstream of the other, this is to be
        exptected. This also shows that the response genes are specific to
        their perturbation and not a common phenotype like stress response
        because of any perturbation.}
