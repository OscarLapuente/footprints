\caption{Difference in gene sets between Perturbation-response genes and Gene
    Ontology/Reactome. Perturbation-response genes are different to pathway
        members and gene annotations, with between 0 and 4 genes in common.
        However, pathway annotation is quite different from gene annotations
        here as well.}
