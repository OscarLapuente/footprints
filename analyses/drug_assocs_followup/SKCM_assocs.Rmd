Associations between predicted pathway activities and drug response:
Expression of VEGF/PDGF-responsive genes mediates resistance to FH535
(Tcf/beta catenin inhibitor) with FDR<0.03.

Other hits with a higher FDR (~25%) but additional support include:

* PI3K confers resistance to MEK inhibitors (PD-0325901, RDEA1119,
  Trametinib). This association has additional support in e.g. BRCA.
* Hypoxia confers resistance to LAQ824 (HDAC inhibitor). This is
  also one of the most significant (FDR=1e-3) BRCA associations.

```{r volcano, echo=FALSE}
assocs.tissue %>%
    mutate(label = paste(Yf, scores, sep=":")) %>%
    plt$color$p_effect(pvalue="adj.p", effect="estimate", dir=-1) %>%
    plt$volcano(p=0.2)
```

Below are the linear fits between predicted pathway activity and drug
response to FH535, with cell lines coloured by PDGFR A/B expression.

Results suggest that for at least a part of the resistant cell lines,
this is mediated by PDGF signaling caused by receptor (over-)expression.
