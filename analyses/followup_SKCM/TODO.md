#### Drug associations

10 measured data points min, 1 top hit: VEGF-responsive genes provide resistance to FH-535

#### Gene expression

Look if VEGF is expressed in a subset/all of SKCM cell lines; could use pathway expression
enrichment scores here.

#### LINCS check

Treating with a VEGF inhibitor, does the VEGF signature decrease?
