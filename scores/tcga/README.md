# Pathway scores for TCGA cohorts

## Score calculation

Methods that require normals only calculate scores where there are tissue-matched normals available

* SPIA
* Pathifier

Methods that just calculate the score do that for all TCGA cancer types

* speed_matrix
* PARADIGM
* GSEA-based methods (GO, Reactome)
* GSVA-based methods (GO, Reactome)
